# Brief Description

A common misconception of sign language is that it is the same everywhere; in reality there are as many as 300 different languages (approximately 50 of these from Africa) with new signs evolving each day as a need appears. Kenyan Sign Language (KSL) is used in Kenya and Somalia, and there are different dialects depending on what region you are in. It is used by over half of Kenya's estimated 600 000-strong deaf population.

The objective of this competition is to build a model to recognise ten different everyday KSL signs present in the images, using machine learning or deep learning algorithms.

This dataset was collected specifically for a Zindi competition. Almost all of the hands are hands of people of colour, in an effort to address bias in sign language datasets. In this effort, the dataset is a public good and open to all to use. We encourage all solutions and derivatives of this dataset to be shared publicly as a public good to the sector.
